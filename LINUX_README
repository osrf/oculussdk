WHAT SETUP IS REQUIRED?

  * Appropriate permissions for Oculus hidraw devices. See
    LibOVR/90-oculus.rules and ConfigureDebian.sh.
  * Use a multihead setup with one X screen spanning both displays (such as
    NVidia TwinView) or place the rift on an independent X screen.
  * Ensure oculusd is running when using the rift.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

  After installing the appropriate packages issue 'make' in the root of
  the SDK directory. This will build a release version of Oculus World Demo
  (OWD). To generate debug symbols use 'make DEBUG=1'.

HOW DO I RUN OCULUS WORLD DEMO (OWD)?

  Either run the binary directly from the output directory, or use 'make run'.

SHOULD I ROTATE MY DEVICE'S SCREEN?

  Manual screen rotation is not recommended. If your window is fullscreen on a
  rift device, set the ovrDistortionCap_LinuxDevFullscreen distortion cap to
  have the SDK automatically rotate the distortion mesh on appropriate devices.
  Be aware you will have to account for window size. You can use
  OVR::SDKWindow::findDevScreenForHMD (Displays/OVR_Linux_SDKWindow.h) to
  return the screen offset and dimensions necessary to size your Linux window.
  See Samples/CommonSrc/Platform/Linux_Platform.cpp for an example.

TWINVIEW

  You must sync to the Rift's display device for a smooth experience when using
  TwinView. To consistently sync to the rift with TwinView setups, set the
  __GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE environment variable to the appropriate display
  device before X starts. For example in your /etc/profile you could place the
  following:

    export __GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE="DFP-1"

  if your rift corresponds to DFP-1.

STARTING THE TRACKING SERVICE AUTOMATICALLY

  Start the tracking service when a user is logged in using Xsession files.

UBUNTU USERS

  There was a ubuntu-specific kernel bug which affected HID devices in 14.04.
  If you are receiving feature report failures try upgrading your distro
  (dist-upgrade).

KNOWN ISSUES

  * OWD vsync initially disabled on Radeon proprietary.
  * Frame loss on NVidia TwinView setups. Use an independent X screen for an
    optimal experience.
  * Mesa DK2 latency tester does not function properly in OWD.
